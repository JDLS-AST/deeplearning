# Pong Game Using NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) Algorithm
---
## To start running this game locally in your system, take following steps:

#### Step1: Download all the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: If you want to train your own AI, then you could run the following command:
```
python train.py
```
*It might take hours before your AI gets trained to be successfully able to play against you.*

#### Step 3: Your best AI model would get automatically saved after training, to play against that model, run following command:
``` python
python test.py
```

#### Step 4: You could also play against with the already saved best model:
```
python game.py
```
